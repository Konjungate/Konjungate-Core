## What is Konjungate?
KONJUNGATE - The Artbased Blockchain is based on the cyber novel MACHFELD by Michael Mastrototaro © 1999

Konjungate will chance the funding of contemporary Art and Art-Institutions using blockchain technology to change the way of contemporary art funding. 
We are also developping our side chain solution. In addition to NFTs and Smart Contracts, this will also enable Web3 and dAPPs solutions. As part of the UUNIGATE community, our chain will then be able to communicate with all the alt coins involved. It’s even possible to “Whitelist” ETH and BSC and other network contracts we deem viable and safe for our users to interact with and allow them to join our fractal ecosystem More about this in a separate announcement.

KONJUNGATE is based on the cyber novel MACHFELD written 1999 by Michael Mastrototaro. Strangely, the main character of the book is called Nakomoto and thus resembles the pseudonym of the BITCOIN inventor Satoshi Nakomoto. What a coincidence, right? Anyway. In his cyber novel, Michael Mastrototaro describes 9 years before Bitcoin appears on the cryptocurrency horizon the mining of KONJUNGATE. Now 20 years after publishing the novel online, KONJUNGATE appears as a Media Art project to decentralize the funding of international contemporary Artists and Institutions and to give a strong artistic statement in times of budget cuts.

### BVAC (Bits Visualized As Color)
BVAC is a unique system that we developed and created in house just for KONJ, Espers and other associated projects. This offers us the ability to store ANY data as a PNG or JPG, similarly to a QR code, with only three files being required as apposed to three entire libraries that QR codes require and the data storage is denser. If you would like to learn more about this feature feel free to reach out to CryptoCoderz or SaltineChips. The current proof of concept implementation is the ability to store and read a public receiving address as a 16x16 BVAC image. Users can share their public keys this way by simply sending each other the BVAC image of the pubkey created from the wallet and then the receiving part is able to load the image using the wallet and decode it into the pubkey once again.

### Tokens (Like ETH)
Along with NFTs we have adapted the technology in the Fractal platform to launch and manage Tokens! No longer are there only the few giants that can do this, launch your own Token using Konjungate [KONJ] as "GAS" and for no where near the fees!

### NFT (Non-fungible Token)
Introducing altcoins to NFTs, as of v1.1.6.3 prototype now features NFT capabilities. This offers the ability to artists, musicians and animators alike a unified place to store, encrypt, protect, sell and share their artwork! Current compatible formats are JPG/JPEG, PNG, GIF (Animation), OGG VORBIS (Audio) in a square format for initial testing for pictures/animation and up to 5 minute sound files for OGG VORBIS audio. This is a soft limit done only for initial testing. These limits will soon be lifted for full release in future versions. This will also be how we store a student's degrees, transcripts, etc.
We will enable NFT's on our international art project https://wendy.network once we go public with it!

## Blockchain Technology
The Konjungate [KONJ] Blockchain is an experimental smart contract platform protocol that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world in a private, secure manner. Konjungate [KONJ] uses peer-to-peer blockchain technology developed by Konjungate to operate with no central authority: managing transactions, execution of contracts, and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Konjungate [KONJ] is the name of open source software which enables the use of this protocol.

## Custom Difficulty Retarget Algorithm “VRX”
VRX is designed from the ground up to integrate properly with the Velocity parameter enforcement system to ensure users no longer receive orphan blocks.

## Velocity Block Constraint System
Ensuring Insane stays as secure and robust as possible the CryptoCoderz team have implemented what's known as the Velocity block constraint system. This system acts as third and final check for both mined and peer-accepted blocks ensuring that all parameters are strictly enforced.
Wish (bmw512) Proof-of-Work Algorithm

## Wish or bmw512 hashing algorithm
is utilized for the Proof-of-Work function and also replaces much of the underlying codebase hashing functions as well that normally are SHA256. By doing so this codebase is able to be both exponentially lighter and more secure in comparison to reference implementations.

## Specifications and General info

Konjungate uses

```libsecp256k1,
libgmp,
Boost1.74

## Run Konjungate daemon

```cd ~; Konjungated; Konjungated getinfo```


## Troubleshooting
for basic troubleshooting run the following commands when compiling:
this is for minupnpc errors compiling

```make clean -f makefile.unix USE_UPNP=-
make -f makefile.unix USE_UPNP=-
```

## Updating daemon in bin directory

```cd ~; cp -r ~/Konjungate/src/Konjungated /usr/local/bin```


## License

Konjungate Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See COPYING for more information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

## Development Process

The master branch is meant to be stable. Development is normally done in separate branches. Tags are created to indicate new official, stable release versions of Konjungate Core.

The contribution workflow is described in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Testing

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people lots of money.

## Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run (assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: make check

There are also regression and integration tests of the RPC interface, written in Python, that are run automatically on the build server. These tests can be run (if the test dependencies are installed) with: qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows and Linux, OS X, and that unit and sanity tests are automatically run.

## Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is not straightforward.
